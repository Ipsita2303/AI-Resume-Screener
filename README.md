## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Resume Screening System** is a full‑stack web application designed to help recruiters automatically analyze and rank resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **semantic similarity techniques** to compare candidate resumes with job requirements and generate a ranked list of candidates.

This project simulates a simplified **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** used by modern companies to speed up the candidate shortlisting process.

It demonstrates integration of:

* Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Backend API development using **FastAPI**
* **NLP embeddings** for resume similarity
* PDF resume parsing
* Client‑server communication

# ⚙️ Installation & Setup

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Resume-Screener.git
cd AI-Resume-Screener
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3️⃣ Run the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend folder:

```
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Server will run at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

# 📊 Example Workflow

1. User enters a **job description**.
2. User uploads multiple **candidate resumes**.
3. Frontend sends data to the **FastAPI backend**.
4. Backend extracts text from the uploaded PDFs.
5. NLP model converts text to **embeddings**.
6. **Cosine similarity** compares resume with job description.
7. Candidates are **ranked by relevance score**.
8. Results are returned and displayed in the UI.
